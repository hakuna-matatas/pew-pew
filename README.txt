To run our system. There is some system configuration that has to be done. The cohttp, lwt, cohttp-lwt-unix, yojson, sdl, and graphics library have to be installed. This can be done with opam depext <package> to install the system packages to run package and then just opam install <package>. Then go inside the router.ml file and change the root to the ip address that will host the server. DO NOT use localhost, as that will just break it because of the cohttp library. Use “http://<ip_address>:8000”. Then on the server machine run ‘make main’, and on the client machine run  ‘make lobby’. Then you choose a lobby to join, or create one, and then play the game. May the odds be ever in your favor.

Note that installation of sdl on Mac OS requires several steps, which can be found here: https://vog.github.io/ocamlsdl-tutorial/.
